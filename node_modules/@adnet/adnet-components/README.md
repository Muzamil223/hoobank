# Adnet components library

## Building project
Building is done with command ``npm run build`` or with the equivalent command ``tsc & vite build``. 
After building is done, build files are located in dist folder in project root. 

To generate compressed package ready for local deployment use command ``npm pack``. Command ``npm pack`` produces
compressed file *adnet_components-x.y.z.tgz* .

Let's say that local npm package resides in desktop folder of user Mark (C:\Users\Mark\Desktop). To install local
npm package use command ``npm install C:\Users\Mark\Desktop\adnet_components-x.y.z.tgz``.

TODO - explain how to install package from private library repository

## Fonts
Inter.ttf font is bundled in project library. To include it in host project something like this
```css
    @font-face {
        font-family: Inter;
        src: url('../../node_modules/adnet_components/dist/fonts/Inter.ttf') format('truetype');
        font-weight: normal;
        font-style: normal;
    }

    html {
        height: 100%;
        font-family: Inter, monospace;
    }
```
should be put in one of hosts css file.

## TODO
1. In *tsconfig.json* file *noUnusedLocals* and *noUnusedParameters* are set to false. Return them to *true* and fix 
code so build would pass with stricter typescript rules.

2. In file *vite.config.ts* under *external* properties are listed npm packages that are not bundled into library. 
Packages *date-fns* and *date-fns-tz* should probably also be added. On that note, peer dependency list should be included in 
*package.json* file.

3. React contexts are not exported in *index.ts* file. Should probably be added.

4. Decide what content from folders *lib*, *locale*, *Models* should also be included in *index.ts* file.

5. All icons exported in *index.ts* file should probably be replaced with icon factory component.

6. Npm command ``npm run build-storybook`` or equivalent ``storybook build`` is not working because of package *storybook-fixtures*.

7. Package *storybook-fixtures* should be moved from dependencies to devDependencies.
